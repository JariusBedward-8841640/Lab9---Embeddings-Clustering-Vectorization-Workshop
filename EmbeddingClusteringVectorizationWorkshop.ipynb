base to a year and the payroll tax to per cent per cent each', 'similar payroll tax boosts would be imposed on those under the railroad retirement system', 'the payroll tax would actually rise to per

the taxpayers expense but who are nevertheless staggered by the drain on their savings or those of their children caused by an extended hospital stay', 'this is a very modest proposal cut to meet absolutely essential needs he said and with sufficient deductible requirements to discourage any malingering or unnecessary overcrowding of our hospitals', 'this is not a program of socialized

contributions to each medical and dental school equal to a year for onefourth of the first year students', 'the schools could use the money to pay year scholarships based on need of up to a year per

capital of the alliance is today closer to the nato line', 'on the negative side of the balance sheet must be set some disappointment that the united states leadership has not been as much in evidence as hoped for', 'one diplomat described the tenor of secretary of state dean rusks speeches as inconclusive', 'but he hastened to add that if united states policies were not always clear despite mr rusks analysis of the various global danger points and setbacks for the west this may merely mean the new administration has not yet firmly fixed its policy', 'exploratory mood', 'a certain vagueness may also be caused by tactical appreciation of the fact that the present council meeting is a semipublic affair with no fewer than six soviet correspondents accredited', 'the impression has nevertheless been given during these three days despite mr rusks personal popularity that the united states delegation came to oslo in a somewhat tentative and exploratory frame of mind more ready to listen and learn than to enunciate firm policy on a global scale with detailed application to individual danger spots', 'the secretary of state himself in his first speech gave some idea of the tremendous march of events inside and outside the united states that has preoccupied the new administration in the past four months', 'but where the core of nato is concerned the secretary of state has not only reiterated the united states profound attachment to the alliance cornerstone of its foreign policy but has announced that five nuclear submarines will eventually be at natos disposal in european waters', 'the secretary of state has also solemnly repeated a warning to the soviet union that the united states will not stand for another setback in berlin an affirmation once again taken up by the council as a whole', 'conflict surveyed', 'the secretarys greatest achievement is perhaps the rekindling of nato realization that eastwest friction wherever it take place around the globe is in essence the general conflict between two entirely different societies and must be treated as such without regard to geographical distance or lack of apparent connection', 'the annual spring meeting has given an impetus in three main directions more deeper and more timely political consultation within the alliance the use of the organization for economic cooperation and development when ratified as a method of coordinating aid to the underdeveloped countries and the need for strengthening conventional forces as well as the maintenance of the nuclear deterrent', 'this increase in the threshold as the conventional forces strengthening is called will prove one of the alliances most difficult problems in the months to come', 'each ally will have to carry out obligations long since laid down but never completely fulfilled', 'washington', 'the kennedy administration moves haltingly toward a geneva conference on laos just as serious debate over its foreign policy erupts for the first time',

officials explain now is mainly interested in setting up an international inspection system which will prevent laos from being used as a base for communist attacks on neighboring thailand and south viet nam', 'they count on the aid of the neutral countries attending the geneva conference to achieve this', 'the united states hopes that any future lao cabinet would not become communist dominated', 'but it is apparent that no acceptable formula has been found to prevent such a possibility', 'policies modified', 'the inclination here is to accept a de facto ceasefire in laos rather than continue to insist on a verification of the ceasefire by the international control commission before participating in the geneva conference', 'this is another of the modifications of policy on laos that the kennedy administration has felt compelled to make', 'it excuses these actions as being the chain reaction to basic errors made in the previous administration', 'its spokesmen insist that there has not been time enough to institute reforms in military and economic aid policies in the critical areas', 'but with the months moving on and the immediate confrontations with the communists showing no gain for the free world the question arises', 'how effective have kennedy administration first foreign policy decisions been in dealing with communist aggression', 'former vicepresident richard m nixon in detroit called for a firmer and tougher policy toward the soviet union', 'he was critical of what he feels is president kennedys tendency to be too conciliatory', 'gop restrained', 'it does not take a gallup poll to find out that most republicans in congress feel this understates the situation as republicans see it', 'they can hardly restrain themselves from raising the question of whether republicans if they had been in power would have made amateurish and monumental blunders in cuba', 'one republican senator told this correspondent that he was constantly being asked why he didnt attack the kennedy administration on this score', 'his reply he said was that he agreed to the need for unity in the country now', 'but he further said that it was better politics to let others question the wisdom of administration policies first', 'the republicans some weeks ago served notice through senator thruston b morton r of kentucky chairman of the republican national committee that the kennedy administration would be held responsible if the outcome in laos was a coalition government susceptible of communist domination', 'kennedy administration policies also have been assailed now from another direction by harvard boston university brandeis and massachusetts institute of technology educators', 'detente urged', 'this group pleads with the administration to give no further support for the invasion of cuba by exile groups', 'it recommends that the united states seek instead to detach the castro regime from the communist bloc by working for a diplomatic detente and a resumption of trade relations', 'and concentrate its constructive efforts on eliminating in other parts of latin america the social conditions on which totalitarian nationalism feeds', 'mr nixon for his part would oppose intervention in cuba without specific provocation', 'but he did recommend that president kennedy state clearly that if communist countries shipped any further arms to cuba that it would not be tolerated', 'until the cuban fiasco and the communist military victories in laos almost any observer would have said that president kennedy had blended a program that respected generally the opinions voiced both by mr nixon and the professors', 'aid plans revamped', 'very early in his administration he informed the kremlin through diplomatic channels a high official source disclosed that the new administration would react even tougher than the eisenhower administration would during the formative period of the administration', 'strenuous efforts were made to remove pin pricking from administration statements', 'policies on nuclear test ban negotiations were reviewed and changed', 'but thus far there has been no response in kind', 'foreign aid programs were revamped to give greater emphasis to economic aid and to encourage political reform in recipient nations', 'in laos the administration looked at the eisenhower administration efforts to show determination by sailing a naval fleet into southeast asian waters as a useless gesture', 'again and again it asked the communists to freeze the military situation in laos', 'but the communists aided the pathet lao at an even faster rate', 'and after several correspondents went into pathet lao territory and exposed the huge buildup administration spokesmen acclaimed them for performing a great service and laid the matter before the southeast asia treaty organization', 'seato was steamed up and prepared contingency plans for coping with the military losses in laos', 'but the communists never gave sufficient provocation at any one time for the united states to want to risk a limited or an allout war over laos', 'some seato nations disagreed however', '', 'there was the further complication that the administration had very early concluded that laos was ill suited to be an ally unlike its more determined neighbors thailand and south viet nam', 'the administration declared itself in favor of a neutralized laos', 'the prowestern government which the united states had helped in a revolt against the souvanna phouma neutralist government never did appear to spark much fighting spirit in the royal lao army', 'there certainly was not any more energy displayed after it was clear the united states would not back the prowestern government to the hilt', 'if the administration ever had any ideas that it could find an acceptable alternative to prince souvanna phouma whom it felt was too trusting of communists it gradually had to relinquish them', 'one factor was the statement of senator j w fulbright d of arkansas chairman of the senate foreign relations committee', 'he declared on march that the united states had erred a year and a half ago by encouraging the removal of prince souvanna', 'washington', 'the white house is taking extraordinary steps to check the rapid growth of juvenile delinquency in the united states', 'the president is deeply concerned over this problem and its effect upon the vitality of the nation', 'in an important assertion of national leadership in this field he has issued an executive order establishing the presidents committee on juvenile delinquency and crime to be supported and assisted by a citizens advisory council of recognized authorities on juvenile problems', 'the president asks the support and cooperation of congress in his efforts through the enactment of legislation to provide federal grants to states for specified efforts in combating this disturbing crime trend', 'offenses multiply', 'the president has also called upon the attorney general the secretary of health education and welfare and the secretary of labor to coordinate their efforts in the development of a program of federal leadership to assist states and local communities in their efforts to cope with the problem', 'simultaneously the president announced thursday the appointment of david l hackett a special assistant to the attorney general as executive director of the new committee on juvenile delinquency and youth crime', 'his sense of urgency in this matter stems from the fact that court cases and juvenile arrests have more than doubled since each year showing an increase in offenders', 'among arrests reported by the federal bureau of investigation in about half for burglary and larceny involved persons under years of age', 'east providence should organize its civil defense setup and begin by appointing a fulltime director raymond h hawksley the present city cd head believes', 'mr hawksley said yesterday he would be willing to go before the city council or anyone else locally to outline his proposal at the earliest possible time', 'east providence now has no civil defense program', 'mr hawksley the states general treasurer has been a parttime cd director in the city for the last nine years', 'he is not interested in being named a fulltime director', 'noting that president kennedy has handed the defense department the major responsibility for the nations civil defense program mr hawksley said the federal government would pay half the salary of a fulltime local director', 'he expressed the opinion the city could hire a cd director for about a year and would only have to put up half that amount on a matching fund basis to defray the salary costs', 'mr hawksley said he believed there are a number of qualified city residents who would be willing to take the fulltime cd job', 'one of these men is former fire chief john a laughlin he said', 'along with a director the city should provide a cd headquarters so that pertinent information about the local organization would be centralized', 'mr hawksley said', 'one advantage that would come to the city in having a fulltime director he said is that east providence would become eligible to apply to the federal government for financial aid in purchasing equipment needed for a sound civil defense program', 'matching funds also can be obtained for procurement of such items as radios sirens and rescue trucks he said', 'mr hawksley believes that east providence could use two more rescue trucks similar to the cd vehicle obtained several years ago and now detailed to the central fire station', 'he would assign one of the rescue trucks to the riverside section of the city and the other to the rumford area', 'speaking of the present status of civil defense in the city mr hawksley said he would be willing to bet that not more than one person in a hundred would know what to do or where to go in the event of an enemy attack', 'the

not critical of city residents for not knowing what to do or where to assemble in case of an air attack', 'such vital information he said has to be made available to the public frequently and at regular intervals for residents to know', 'if the city council fails to consider appointment of a fulltime cd director mr hawksley said then he plans to call a meeting early in september so that a civil defense organization will be developed locally', 'one of the first things he would do he said would be to organize classes in first aid', 'other steps would be developed after information drifts

benefit of his views', 'he will then appoint the study committee with mr nugents cooperation the governor said', 'i would expect the proposed committee to hold public hearings mr notte said to obtain the views of the general public and religious labor and specialinterest groups affected by these laws', 'the governor wrote miss grant that he has been concerned for some time with the continuous problem which confronts our local and state law enforcement officers as a result of the laws regulating sunday sales', 'the attorney general has advised local police that it is their duty to enforce the blue laws', 'should there be evidence they are shirking he has said the state police will step into the situation', 'there has been more activity across the state line in massachusetts than in

pass under both major parties', 'mr reama who retired as vice president of the american screw co in said both parties in the last election told us that we need a five per cent growth in the gross national product but neither told us how to achieve it', 'he said he favors wage increases for workers but manufacturers are caught in a profit squeeze and raises should only come when the public is conditioned to higher prices he added', 'indicating the way in which he has turned his back on his philosophy mr reama said a socialist is a person who believes in dividing everything he does not own', 'mr reama far from really being retired is engaged in industrial relations counseling', 'a petition bearing the signatures of more than johnston taxpayers was presented to the town council last night as what is hoped will be the first step in obtaining a home rule charter for the town', 'william a martinelli chairman of the citizens group of johnston transferred the petitions from his left
